# tinymce6-react-pcf

This component wraps the latest version of the React Tiny MCE component (6.8.2 at the time of development) using the Power Component Framework (PCF).

It's a work in progress and only limited funcionality is included at the moment.

I've tested it in both Model-driven and Canvas Apps.  Works well in both.
